# SQL-Chatbot

We created a chatbot that allows the user to log in and connect to the mySQL server using his credentials, to create a database or connect to an existing one and perform the actions of Show Tables, Create Table, Drop Table, Create View, Update View, Drop View, Insert, Update, Delete, Select which are part of SQL, as well as Exit the program and end the connection with the workbench. In short it hides the implementation of SQL from the user, allowing him to run his desired queries (even nested Selects) using plain English without the need for further knowledge of SQL. After choosing an action he can input the needed values and call the corresponding function with this input as parameter in order to create the query and execute it.
